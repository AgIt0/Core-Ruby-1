# Taylor Series

Because we know you love your calculus classes, we present you the final of our
_Y U GIVE US SOME MUCH MATH_ series with the, ahem, [Taylor series].

In mathematics, a [Taylor series] is a representation of a function as an
infinite sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function's
derivatives at a single point. It is common practice to approximate a function
by using a finite number of terms of its Taylor series.

The [Taylor series] are interesting, because you can use them to approximate
your common trigonometric functions. We want you to calculate Sine and Cosine
using their respective [Taylor series]. You can find them [here].

The interface for the Sine function should be `sine(x, precision)`, where
precision is the upper limit of `n`.

The interface for the Cosine function should be `cosine(x, precision)`, where
precision is the upper limit of `n`.

The higher the `precision` is, the better the approximation.
