# Week 1

Welcome to the first set of problems for week 1. Here are a couple of resources
you may find useful, while digging into them:

* http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Array.html
* http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Hash.html
* http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/String.html

If you don't feel confident with the building blocks yet, a couple of lessons
on http://tryruby.org/ can help you digest the above documentation better.

## Problems

### Histogram

Create a histogram with each character and the number of its occurrences in
arbitrary string.

```ruby
def histogram(string)
  # Your code goes here.
end

>> histogram("abraca")
=> {"a"=>3, "b"=>1, "r"=>1, "c"=>1}
```
